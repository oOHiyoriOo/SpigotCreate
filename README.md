# SpigotCreate
__ __
### Notice
>Goal of this Project to see if something like Create mod could be made a Plugin, this could open up the mod for so many more players and make some interesting Servers.
>
>Mostly this is learning more about Spigot and Java development, challenging myself and my Knowledge / Skill in Plugin development.
>
>This is propably not going to be a well maintained / updated Plugin, as it's intended to be a wild playground for some learning and growing as a Developer.
>
>If you know of an Improvment, that can be made, feel free to Tell me / us, as the whole point here is getting better.
